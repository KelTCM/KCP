WARNING!!! EARLY PHASE OF KCP BEFORE ALPHA BEGAN
THERE ARE GOING TO BE MANY BUGS AND MANY THINGS
MISSING FROM THE LATER EDITIONS OF KCP (0.05 Or 
Later)!!!

The Customization Update

Change Log:
    All UTC Functions are Gone And Replaced With An Argument, for an exaple, let UTCYear = year((UTC is the Argument, 
    it's boolean, so if your getting the UTC Year, you will need to put as true)
    true)
    so say it's 10pm UTC, heres an example of what it will show
    console.log(UTCYear)
    it will then return 22
    22
Bug Fixes:
    Customization for shapes now works Properly!
